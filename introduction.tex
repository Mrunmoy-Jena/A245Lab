The aim of this experiment is to explore and understand a non-linear optical effect - the generation and the properties of second harmonic waves. We study the dependence of it to various parameters in this experiment, which will be important in understanding this effect. In this experiment, a potassium niobate crystal (KNbO3) is irradiated with a high-power diode laser at 987nm (fundamental beam) to observe the frequency doubling effect. We also explore two different methods to determine the wavelength relation of the two beams involved.\\
This report is divided into multiple sections. The first section discusses the relevant theory briefly, the second section discusses the procedure and analysis and finally we discuss the conclusion. This is followed by the raw data from the experiment.
